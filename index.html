        <div class="about-card">
            <p>
                I am from Junnar, Maharashtra, and currently working at EightyTwo East IT Solutions with my client
                Yodel,
                a UK-based logistics company providing B2B and B2C services for over 14 years.
            </p>
            <p>
                I specialize in creating dynamic and responsive user interfaces using React and Redux Toolkit, focusing
                on
                improving user experience and performance. My work on the Transportation Management System module,
                particularly the Air Cargo Management System, allows me to address challenges in logistics effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about learning new technologies and continuously enhancing my skills. I enjoy
                collaborating
                with cross-functional teams and leveraging my knowledge of Tailwind CSS, Chart.js, and testing
                frameworks
                like Jest and React Testing Library to deliver high-quality software solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, exploring new frameworks, and staying
                updated
                with industry trends. I believe in the power of technology to transform businesses and improve everyday
                life.
            </p>
